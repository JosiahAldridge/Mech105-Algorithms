# luFactor
luFactor uses Gaussian elimination to solve for a combined L and U matrix from the input of a square matrix.
It also uses partial pivoting if necessary and will return the P matrix as such.
The function works fine for 2- and 3-square matrices, but does not work correctly for 4+ matrices.
