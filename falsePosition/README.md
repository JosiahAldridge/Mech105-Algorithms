# falsePosition
falsePosition uses the false position method to solve for a function's root; it also returns the function evaulated at the root, the relative approximate error, and the number of iterations of the method used.
It requires the input of a function, any other arguments the function may have, a lower and upper bound for the root, a desired error, and a maximum number of iterations. The last two are optional.
